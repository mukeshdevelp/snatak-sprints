## 1. Scope and context

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Application** | Java/Spring Boot microservice; Maven build; dependencies in `pom.xml`. |
| **Repo location** | Java project directory (e.g. **~/salary/salary-api** or your Maven project path). |
| **Build** | `mvn clean package` (or `make build`); produces the application JAR in `target/`. |
| **POC goal** | Add **OWASP Dependency-Check** to the CI pipeline for the Java (Maven) project; fail on high/critical CVEs. |

---

## 2. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Java and Maven** | Java 17+, Maven (per project `pom.xml`). |
| **Java project repo** | Clone or use the existing Java (Maven) project directory; ensure `pom.xml` is present. |
| **CI system** | GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar (one pipeline for the POC). |
| **Scanner** | **OWASP Dependency-Check** (Maven plugin or CLI). Works on the project `pom.xml` and dependency tree. |

# OWASP Dependency Scanning Guide (Maven Project)

This guide explains **how to perform dependency vulnerability scanning in a Maven Java project using OWASP Dependency-Check**. It is designed for **beginners** who are running dependency scanning for the first time.

---

# 1. What is Dependency Scanning?

Dependency scanning checks the **third-party libraries used in your project** for **known security vulnerabilities (CVEs)**.

Example:
If your project uses an outdated `log4j` library with a known vulnerability, the scanner will detect it and report the risk.

OWASP Dependency-Check compares your dependencies against the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**.

---

# 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following tools are installed.

### Check Java

```bash
java -version
```

Expected output (example):

```
openjdk version "17.x.x"
```

### Check Maven

```bash
mvn -version
```

If Maven is not installed (Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update

```

---

# 3. Navigate to Your Maven Project

Go to your project directory that contains `pom.xml`.

Example:

```bash
cd salary-api
```

Project structure example:

```
salary-api
│
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java
└── target
```

---

# 4. Add OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin

Open the **pom.xml** file and add the plugin inside the `<plugins>` section.

```xml

<plugins>

  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
    <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
    <version>9.0.0</version>
  </plugin>

</plugins>

```

Save the file.

---

# 5. Generate an NVD API Key

OWASP downloads vulnerability data from the **NVD database**, which requires an API key.

1. Visit
   https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key

2. Enter your email address.

3. You will receive an **API key in your email**.

Example API key:

```
abcd1234-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx
```
<img width="1919" height="873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446b2028-c133-4c48-a64f-b3c8155676e1" />

---

# 6. Run the Dependency Scan

Run the following command:

```bash
mvn dependency-check:check -DnvdApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example:

```bash
mvn dependency-check:check -DnvdApiKey=abcd1234-xxxx
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/owasp
rm -rf ~/.dependency-check
```

What happens during the scan:

1. Maven downloads project dependencies
2. OWASP downloads vulnerability data
3. Dependencies are matched with known CVEs
4. A vulnerability report is generated

---

# 7. Locate the Scan Report

After the scan finishes, the report will be generated in:

```
target/dependency-check-report.html
```

---

# 8. Open the Report

If you are running locally:

```bash
xdg-open target/dependency-check-report.html
```

If the scan was run on a server:

```bash
scp user@server:/project/target/dependency-check-report.html .
```

Open the file in a browser.

---

# 9. Understand the Report

The report will show vulnerabilities in a table.

Example:

| Dependency       | CVE            | Severity |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| log4j-core       | CVE-2021-44228 | Critical |
| jackson-databind | CVE-2020-36518 | High     |

Severity levels:

* Critical
* High
* Medium
* Low

---

# 10. Fix Vulnerable Dependencies

Update vulnerable libraries in `pom.xml`.

Example (old version):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.14.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Updated version:

```xml
<version>2.17.2</version>
```

After updating:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Run the scan again.

---

# 11. Optional: Fail Build if Vulnerabilities Exist

You can configure the build to fail if high-severity vulnerabilities are found.

Add this configuration in the plugin:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
  <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
  <version>9.0.0</version>
  <configuration>
      <failBuildOnCVSS>7</failBuildOnCVSS>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

This will fail the build if vulnerabilities have a **CVSS score ≥ 7**.

# 12. Typical DevSecOps Workflow

```
Developer Commit
       ↓
Maven Build
       ↓
Unit Tests
       ↓
OWASP Dependency Scan
       ↓
Generate Vulnerability Report
       ↓
Fix Vulnerable Dependencies
```

---

# 13. Useful Commands

Run dependency scan:

```bash
mvn dependency-check:check
```

Full build + scan:

```bash
mvn clean install dependency-check:check
```

Run with API key:

```bash
mvn dependency-check:check -DnvdApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

# 14. Best Practices

* Run dependency scanning in **CI/CD pipelines**
* Regularly update dependencies
* Monitor **Critical and High vulnerabilities**
* Combine dependency scanning with:

  * Static Code Analysis
  * Container Security Scanning
  * Secret Scanning

## 7. Success criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Java application builds successfully in CI (`make build` or `mvn clean package`). | ☐ |
| OWASP Dependency-Check runs in CI on the Java project. | ☐ |
| Scan report is published as an artifact (or visible in security dashboard). | ☐ |
| Pipeline fails on high/critical CVEs (per configured threshold). | ☐ |
| At least one vulnerability is remediated and pipeline passes after fix. | ☐ |
| Process is documented (scanner, threshold, commands). | ☐ |
