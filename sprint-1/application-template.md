## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Diagram
Insert your architecture diagram here (a simple block diagram works).

### 4.2 Data Flow

Describe each component and show direction of data:

```
User / Client
    ↓
Frontend (User interface or dashboard used to access APIs)
    ↓
Backend APIs (Handle business logic: Employee, Salary, etc.)
    ↓
Redis Cache (Caching layer for faster data retrieval)
    ↓
Database (ScyllaDB/PostgreSQL for data persistence)
```

Or in line: **User** → **Frontend** → **Backend APIs** → **Redis Cache** → **Database**

## 6. Monitoring

Monitoring in DevOps refers to the practice of continuously observing and collecting data from various components of an application or system to ensure its health, performance, and availability. It involves tracking various metrics, events, and logs to identify issues, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement. Monitoring is a crucial aspect of the DevOps lifecycle as it helps teams proactively manage and maintain their applications, enabling faster response to problems and better overall system performance.

### 6.1 Metrics

| Parameter | Description | Priority | Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Disk Utilization | The percentage of disk space used by the application. | High | >90% |
| Availability | The percentage of time the application is available. | High | >= 99.9% |
| Memory Utilization | The percentage of memory used by the application. | Medium | >80% |
| CPU Utilization | The percentage of CPU time used by the application. | Medium | >70% |
| Network Traffic | The amount of network traffic generated by the application. | Medium | Varies based on use case |
| Latency | The time taken for the application to respond to a request. | High | < 300ms |
| Errors | The number of errors generated by the application. | High | > 5 per minute |
| Throughput | The number of requests the application can handle per unit of time. | High | > 1000 requests per minute |
| Security | The security of the application (authentication, authorization, encryption). | High | Continuous monitoring |

### 6.2 Health check

| Name | Type | InitialDelaySeconds | PeriodSeconds | TimeoutSeconds | SuccessThreshold | FailureThreshold |
|------|------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| App name | ReadinessProbe | 10 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 3 |
| App name | LivenessProbe | 10 | 10 | — | 5 | 1 |

### 6.3 Explanation of parameters used in above table

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ReadinessProbe | This probe checks if the application is ready to receive traffic. |
| LivenessProbe | This probe checks if the application is still running and responding to requests. |
| InitialDelaySeconds | The number of seconds to wait before the first health check is performed. |
| PeriodSeconds | The frequency at which the health check should be performed. |
| TimeoutSeconds | The maximum amount of time that the health check should wait for a response before it considers the application unhealthy. |
| SuccessThreshold | The number of consecutive successful health checks before the application is considered healthy. |
| FailureThreshold | The number of consecutive unhealthy health checks before the application is considered unhealthy. |
